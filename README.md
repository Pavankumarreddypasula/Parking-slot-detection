This project is focused on parking spot detection and tracking using computer vision techniques. It utilizes OpenCV to process video frames from a parking lot to detect and monitor the status of parking spots. Initially, a mask image is used to identify the parking spot boundaries, and the connected components in the mask are analyzed using connectedComponentsWithStats to extract the bounding boxes of individual parking spots.

 These bounding boxes are used to crop the video frames, where differences in pixel intensity are calculated between consecutive frames to detect changes, which helps in determining if a parking spot is empty or occupied. The status of each parking spot is updated dynamically by comparing the current frame with the previous frame and is displayed in real-time on the video feed.

Free parking spots are indicated with green rectangles, while occupied spots are marked with red. The application also overlays a summary showing the number of available spots and their respective indices on the video frame. The program runs in a loop, processing frames every 30 frames, and ends when the user presses the 'q' key. It is built using OpenCV for image manipulation, NumPy for array operations, and optionally Matplotlib for image visualization. The project serves as a basic foundation for real-time parking lot monitoring and could be enhanced with machine learning models for more accurate spot occupancy detection.

Building a web application using Flask that interfaces with a parking lot video monitoring system. The application allows users to view and interact with real-time parking slot statuses through a web page. Flask serves as the backend, processing parking status updates by analyzing video frames from a parking lot. The core logic uses OpenCV to detect changes in the parking spots, determining whether a spot is occupied or free by comparing frames. The update_parking_status function runs in a separate thread, continuously analyzing video frames and updating the parking status for each spot. The front end is handled by HTML templates rendered by Flask, which display the parking slot statuses to users. When users visit the /parking_status route, the application returns a JSON response with the indices of free parking spots. The / route serves as the homepage, while the /booking route is for a booking page where users can make parking reservations. To connect to the web page, simply run the Flask application, which will start a local server (usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Users can then visit this URL in their browser to interact with the parking status and booking system.
